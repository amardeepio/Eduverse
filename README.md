### ✅ Decentralized Agent Coordination and Trust (Smart Contract Architecture)

**What’s On-Chain:**
- **Agent Registry & Capabilities:**  
  All core agents (e.g., Learning Style Analyst, Content Curator, Personalized Tutor) are registered via smart contracts, with:
  - Unique IDs
  - Defined roles and permissions
  - Clear scope of data access and processing
- **Service Agreements & Orchestration Logic:**  
  Smart contracts manage agent workflows. For example:
  - Completion of a module may trigger the `Progress Tracker`
  - Upon validation, the `Personalized Tutor` recommends next steps
- **Incentive Mechanisms:**  
  Token-based rewards for learning milestones, community engagement, and future decentralized agent marketplaces.

**Why It Needs Blockchain:**
- **Trustless Agent Interaction:**  
  In a multi-agent system, blockchain ensures agent behaviors and interactions are transparent, verifiable, and not reliant on a centralized authority.
- **Guaranteed Execution:**  
  Smart contracts enforce the deterministic execution of workflows, ensuring learning paths adapt in real time based on defined rules.
- **Immutable Rules:**  
  Educational logic, access rights, and reward systems are hard-coded and transparent, fostering trust and accountability.
